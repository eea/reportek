  COMMENT: The Convention covers all the technical aspects of pollution from ships,
    except the disposal of waste into the sea by dumping, and applies to ships of
    all types, although it does not apply to pollution arising out of the exploration
    and exploitation of sea-bed mineral resources. The Convention has two Protocols
    dealing respectively with Reports on Incidents involving Harmful Substances and
    Arbitration; and five Annexes which contain regulations for the prevention of
    various forms of pollution.

  COMMENT: "There are reporting obligations here but they are not environmental obligations,\
    \ mostly technical and not requiring monitoring or assessment data on state of\
    \ the environment or pressures on the environment, so they have not been included\
    \ here. They may need to be considered later if information is needed for Reponses\
    \ to environmental problems in the DPSIR scheme. They are not legal except for\
    \ those incorporated into international laws. \r\nThe most important convention\
    \ regulating and preventing marine pollution by ships is the IMO International\
    \ Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by\
    \ the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPOL 73/78). It covers accidental and\
    \ operational oil pollution as well as pollution by chemicals, goods in packaged\
    \ form, sewage, garbage and air pollution. IMO also has Secretariat responsibilities\
    \ for the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes\
    \ and Other Matter (LDC), 1972, generally known as the London Convention."

  COMMENT: This data set was used for an indicator on soil sealing. This indicator
    has been modified in 2004, and merged into a new indicator integrated into the
    Core Set of Indicators. Hence, this reporting obligation as it has been discontinued.
    The reporting obligation for the new indicator has not yet been stablished at
    the moment of the verification, but is expected in 2005.

  COMMENT: "Information on the on exceptions to the taking of Appendix I species (endangered\
    \ migratory species) should be reported as soon as possible and included in the\
    \ national report.\r\n\r\n The development and adoption of the new reporting format\
    \ for CMS Parties was a component of the CMS Information Management Plan (IMP).\
    \  The IMP aims to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of CMS implementation,\
    \ and to ensure an effective contribution by CMS to harmonised reporting and information\
    \ management by biodiversity-related treaties.  A draft of the IMP was presented\
    \ at the Sixth Meeting of the Conference of the Parties (November 1999) (document\
    \ UNEP/CMS/Conf. 6.7 and Addendum), which issued Resolution 6.5 to provide recommendations\
    \ and instructions on the implementation of the IMP.  To date, implementation\
    \ of the IMP comprises three principal components: 1) the synthesis of Party Reports;\
    \ 2) the new reporting format; and 3) the CMS Information Management System (CMS\
    \ IMS).  The CMS IMS brings together information from Party reports, knowledge\
    \ generated within CMS and other biodiversity agreements, and data from various\
    \ expert organisations.  It is available on the CMS website (www.unep-wcmc.org/cms).\r\
    \n\r\nEEA maintains a biodiversity information system at\r\nhttp://eunis.eea.eu.int/\

    \ guidance when sheets are to be submitted.  Resolution VIII.10 requests all Parties\
    \ to use the revised format of the RIS as adopted in Resolution VIII.13 in their\
    \ designation of new sites, extensions to existing sites and updates of existing\
    \ sites.  Parties are urged to submit an electronic (MS Word) copy of the RIS\
    \ and, where possible, digital copies of maps.\r\n\r\nExplanatory Notes and Guidelines\
    \ for Completing the Information Sheet on Ramsar Wetlands are attached to the\

    \  The most up-to-date available and suitable map of the wetland should be appended\
    \ to the RIS (in hardcopy and, if possible, also in digital format).  Additional\
    \ information on each site, such as taxonomic lists of species' status, management\
    \ plans, copies of published papers or photocopied reports on the site, should\
    \ be appended to the RIS and are treated as part of the official record of the\

  COMMENT: "Additional information on biennial reports can be found in reports prepared\
    \ for meetings of the Conference of the Parties to CITES (e.g. document CoP12\
    \ Doc. 22.2) and the Standing Committee (e.g. document SC49 Doc. 15).\r\n\r\n\
    At its 49th meeting, the Standing Committee established a working group to undertake\
    \ a review of reporting requirements under the Convention.  The aim of this review\
    \ is to identify and analyse the causes of non-compliance with reporting requirements\
    \ and to propose ways to turn reports into useful management tools for Parties\
    \ (Decision 12.87 and document SC49 Doc. 15).  Consequently, work is currently\
    \ underway to develop a new reporting format for biennial reports.  In undertaking\
    \ this work, Document CoP12 Doc. 22.2 states that, in order to reduce the reporting\
    \ burden on Parties, consideration should be given to: 1) keeping the biennial\
    \ report short and simple with a focus of priority topics; 2) after an initial\
    \ biennial report, only highlighting any legislative amendments or changes in\
    \ CITES authorities and new activities; and 3) using a more structured approach\
    \ consistent with agreed guidelines to facilitate more comparative analysis.\r\
    \n\r\nEEA maintains a biodiversity information system at\r\nhttp://eunis.eea.eu.int/\

  COMMENT: "The main outputs planned from FRA 2005 are: 1) country reports, summarising\
    \ the information provided by each country; 2) special reports on key issues,\
    \ such as \"mountain forests\", \"forests and water\", \"biological diversity\"\
    \ and \"planted forests\", drawing largely from country information and other\
    \ sources; 3) a main report that summarises all findings and analyses trends since\
    \ the previous assessment in 2000; and 4) contributions to SOFO 2005.\r\n\r\n\
    The objective of country-level reporting is: 1) to produce by 2005 a comprehensive\
    \ update and refinement of FRA 2000, structured around common themes (criteria)\
    \ for sustainable forest management, building on original national-level information,\
    \ focussing on trend information for a limited set of global variables, and including\
    \ additional country-specific information relevant to each theme; 2) to involve\
    \ National Correspondents and experts to the extent possible in the collection,\
    \ analyses and validation of information to secure national ownership of results;\
    \ 3) to report all information transparently and with complete documentation of\
    \ information sources and analyses applied on source data on the FAO forestry\
    \ website.\r\n\r\nThe information provided is relevant for many international\
    \ processes and agencies, including: 1) Convention on Sustainable Development;\
    \ 2) Convention on Biological Diversity; 3) Convention to Combat Desertification;\
    \ 4) Food and Agriculture Organisation; 5) International Tropical Timber Organisation;\
    \ 6) International Union for the Conservation of Nature; 7) the Ministerial Conference\
    \ on the Protection of Forests in Europe; 8) Eurostat; 9) Millenium Ecosystem\

  DESCRIPTION: Article 12 requires Member States to report about the progress made
    with the implementation of the Birds Directive. The Commission in agreement with
    Member States has revised the reporting procedure in order to focus the reporting
    on data that inform about the status of bird populations, thereby streamlining
    the reporting with the reporting under Article 17 of the Habitats Directive.

  COMMENT: "The Emerald Network is a network of Areas of Special Conservation Interest\
    \ (ASCIs), which is to be established in the territory of the Contracting Parties\
    \ and Observer States to the Bern Convention, including Central and Eastern European\
    \ countries and the EU Member States.  For EU Member States, Emerald Network sites\
    \ are those of Natura 2000.  Recommendation No. 16 (1989) defines ASCIs as those\
    \ designated by states where that area fits one or several of the following conditions:\
    \ 1) it contributes substantially to the survival of threatened species, endemic\
    \ species, or any species listed in Appendices I and II of the Convention; 2)\
    \ it suppose significant numbers of species in an area of high species diversity\
    \ or supports important populations of one or more species; 3) it contains an\
    \ important and/or representative sample of endangered habitat types; 4) it contains\
    \ an outstanding example of a particular habitat type or a mosaic of different\
    \ habitat types; 5) it represents an important area for one or more migratory\
    \ species; or 6) it otherwise contributes significantly to the achievement of\
    \ the objectives of the Convention.  The Emerald Network finds its legal basis\
    \ in the Bern Convention, in particular Articles 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 9.  Several\

    \ and Observer States to the Bern Convention, including Central and Eastern European\
    \ countries and the EU Member States.  For EU Member States, Emerald Network sites\
    \ are those of Natura 2000.  Recommendation No. 16 (1989) defines ASCIs as those\
    \ designated by states where that area fits one or several of the following conditions:\
    \ 1) it contributes substantially to the survival of threatened species, endemic\
    \ species, or any species listed in Appendices I and II of the Convention; 2)\
    \ it suppose significant numbers of species in an area of high species diversity\
    \ or supports important populations of one or more species; 3) it contains an\
    \ important and/or representative sample of endangered habitat types; 4) it contains\
    \ an outstanding example of a particular habitat type or a mosaic of different\

  REPORTING_FORMAT: The Protocol itself is not specific about the format of the reports.
    However, Resolution 6(2001) [Exchange of Information] was adopted by the twenty-fourth
    Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM XXIV) to rationalise the information
    requirements of the Protocol. Many Parties submit their reports as Information
    Papers to annual meetings of the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP),
    whilst others post the information on their national website.

  REPORTING_FORMAT: "Two sets of guidelines for national reporting are provided, one\
    \ for developed country Parties and the other for affected country Parties.\r\n\
    \r\nAs regards developed country Parties, there is an Explanatory Note which provides\
    \ guidance on the information to be included in the report.  It includes as an\
    \ annex a suggested structure for the reports.  Developed country Parties which\
    \ have not yet submitted a report are requested to submit a comprehensive report\
    \ covering the period starting with their ratification of and/or accession of\
    \ the Convention up to the submission date.  Country Parties which have already\
    \ submitted a report are requested to submit an update to the Secretariat. \r\n\
    \r\nA review of the reports of Affected African country Parties will be undertaken\
    \ within the context of CRIC 3 and COP7.  A format for the reports was outlined\
    \ in decision 11/COP.1, but priority areas and key thematic topics identified\
    \ at COP 4 (decision 8/COP.4) and COP 5 (decision 1/COP.5) have been added.  However,\
    \ it is specifically stated that the Help Guide does not provide an obligatory\
    \ format but is rather indicative in providing a format and methodology with a\
    \ view to supporting national focal points in the preparation work for national\
    \ reports.  Country Parties are also requested to submit as part of their national\
    \ report a country profile containing statistical data on geo-topographic, bio-physical\
    \ and socio-economic indicators relevant for an assessment of desertification\
    \ at the national level.  Affected African country Parties are requested to provide\
    \ the UNCCD Secretariat with an update of their previous report, submitted to\
    \ CRIC 1, in the light of COP 6 decisions.  Affected African country Parties which\
    \ have never submitted a report are requested to provide a full comprehensive\
    \ report on activities and measures to implement the Convention since becoming\
    \ a Party.\r\n\r\nReports should be completed in one of the official languages\
    \ of the Conference of the Parties. Affected country Parties are also encouraged\
    \ to submit their reports, or at least summaries of them, in English, to facilitate\
    \ wider dissemination of the information.  National reports submitted by affected\
    \ country Parties should be less than 30 pages, including a six-page summary.\r\
    \n\r\nReports should be submitted as a single document in hard copy as well as\
    \ in an electronic format (as a diskette, a CD-ROM, a website, or an e-mail attachment).\
    \  Reports should be produced in either MS Word 6 or above, or Rich Text Format."

  DESCRIPTION: The Biodiversity Action Plan was issued by the European Commission
    in 2006 to accelerate progress to meet the 2010 target. It addresses the challenge
    of integrating biodiversity concerns into other policy sectors in a unified way.
    It specifies a comprehensive plan of priority actions and outlines the responsibility
    of community institutions and Member States in relation to each. It also contains
    indicators to monitor progress and a timetable for evaluations. The EU has undertaken
    to provide regular reporting on progress in delivery of the Biodiversity Action
    Plan.

  COMMENT: Under the new HELCOM reporting strategy there will be more focus on establishing
    links between driving forces, pressures, state and impacts in the Baltic environment.
    The intension is to collate all relevant data reported by contracting parties
    under current European legislative drivers and to request additional data only
    where it is deemed to be necessary. This will reduce the burden on Contracting
    Parties and imprive efficiency of overall assessment process.

  DESCRIPTION: This Recommendation supplements the provisions on principles for issuing
    permits for industrial plants contained in Annex III, Regulation 3 of the Convention
    aiming especially on the reduction of (HELCOM priority) hazardous substances.
    This Recommendation also supplements several sector specific HELCOM Recommendations.
    Its specific aim is to guide the identification of effective BAT for the control
    of emissions and discharges of Hazardous Substances (identified by HELCOM for
    priority action) as well as nutrients and substances causing oxygen depletion
    in relevant industrial sectors. The aim is also to provide information on substitution
    of hazardous substances by less- or non-hazardous substances.

  COMMENT: This Decision shall be applied to any regulatory action, such as the granting
    of permits or approvals by authorities, concerning the use of, or the discharge
    of, chemicals from offshore sources. In the territory of those Contracting Parties
    where the use and discharge of offshore chemicals are regulated by frame permits
    based on internal (in-company) environmental control and where specific elements
    of the procedures required by the programmes and measures stipulated below are
    carried out by the companies themselves, the authorities shall be responsible
    for effective enforcement and control by a system of regular auditing, inspection

    the continued shift towards the use of less hazardous substances (or preferably
    non-hazardous substances) and, as a result, the reduction of the overall environmental
    impact resulting from the use and discharge of offshore chemicals.

  DATE_COMMENTS: Contracting Parties are required to report encounters on a three
    year cycle. If clusters of munitions encounters occur these should be reported
    as soon as possible.
  DESCRIPTION: This Recommendation aims to promote the reporting of encounters with
    dumped convention and chemical munitions by fishermen and other users of the sea
    and and its coastline, and to establish a record of such encounters. This is to
    facilitate discussion on the management options for dumping sites, identification
    of the extent of areas around known dumping sites and of previously unknown, or
    unrecorded, dumping sites, and designation on navigational charts of areas where
    a high risk exists of encounters on the seabed with dumped conventional and chemical
    munitions.

  DESCRIPTION: The main objectives of litterfall sampling and analysis are to quantify
    litterfall production chemical composition over time in order to, assess the variation
    in litterfall amount and hence its role in nutrient cycling, across an environmental
    gradient of climate (moisture and temperature) and soil conditions, understand
    the relationship of climate and species on litterfall rates, understand the turnover
    of the biomass, the amount of litter produced, its composition and chemical content
    and improve our knowledge on the link between the C and the nutrient budgets/cycles.

  REPORTING_FORMAT: Given that the Water Framework Directive covers all impacts, including
    dangerous substances, the Commission expects that reports under the Water Framework
    Directive within the already agreed reporting format will cover all relevant information
    on these as well. Consequently, the questionnaire under the Decision need not
    be used any more. See for the guidelines of reporting obligations under the Water
    Framework Directive.

  COMMENT: "There is no specific legal base for this questionnaire – it is voluntary\
    \ reporting (gentlemen's agreement), but there is an indirect obligation as EU\
    \ countries have approved in Parliament and Council the 5y Statistical Programme\
    \ and the annual work programmes. In addition, EFTA countries are as well members\
    \ of the ESS (European Statistical System) and have approved the programmes in\
    \ the respective governing body SPC (now called ESS Committee). EU candidate countries\
    \ have to demonstrate their statistical capabilities in the course of their preparation\
    \ for accession.\r\n\r\nThe data, as far as validated by Eurostat, are publicly\
    \ accessible on Eurostat's Database (available at http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/statistics/search_database),\
    \ then go to theme \"Environment and energy\". Eurostat also presents and explains\

  DESCRIPTION: "Joint Questionnaire OECD/Eurostat\r\nThe questionnaire on inland waters\
    \ includes the whole water cycle from abstraction to use and then discharge, and\
    \ additional tables on quality of some rivers and lakes only used by OECD. Quantities\
    \ of water abstracted, and used, capacity of waste water treatment plants, sludges\
    \ produced, and emissions of chemicals, of which heavy metals from the sources\
    \ industry, agriculture and human settlements.\r\n\r\nDelivery process or content\
    \ of this obligation overlaps with another reporting obligations (http://rod.eionet.europa.eu/obligations/184\
    \ , http://rod.eionet.europa.eu/obligations/632 and http://rod.eionet.europa.eu/obligations/613)\
    \ \r\nStreamlining between the WISE-SoE reporting and the Eurostat/OECD Joint\
    \ Questionnaire on Inland Waters (JQ IWA) has been incorporated to the possible\
    \ degree. If countries report data under water quantity and emissions to water\
    \ in 2013, this will be used to pre-fill the 2014 Eurostat/OECD Joint Questionnaire\
    \ and no Eurostat reporting has to be done by the country. In addition, the questionnaire\
    \ will be pre-filled with some parameters introduced under UWWT Directive - Article\
    \ 15 - implementation for 2013 reporting."

    means projections of anthropogenic emissions that encompass the effects, in terms
    of air pollutant emission reductions, of policies and measures that have been
    adopted at the time the projection is calculated. “Projections with additional
    measures” means projections of anthropogenic emissions that encompass the effects
    in terms of air pollutant emission reductions of policies and measures which have
    been adopted, as well as policies and measures which are planned at the time the
    projection is calculated.
